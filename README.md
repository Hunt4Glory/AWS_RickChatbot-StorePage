--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rick Chatbot is an AWS, EC2, web server for an interactive, fan-made sci-fi chatbot based on the fictional character 'Rick' from 'Adult Swim's Rick and Morty'. 
The site acts as a fake e-commerce store, and its main feature is the interactive chatbot. 

It has a brief list of memorabilia from the show that references certain episodes, such as Rick’s classic portal gun and the classic existential crisis-filled butter robot. The site features simplistic colour theming with sci-fi green edge glow replicating the aesthetic from Rick's portal gun.
The Website is built using basic HTML for its structure and CSS and Javascript for front-end development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is deployed on Amazon Web Service’s t2.micro free tier instance and uses Ubuntu 22.04 alongside Apache for its certificates. 

The main objective for creating this chatbot is to explore and present the possibility of themed AI assistants across the web. 
The rick-bot is designed to be a very basic test to show that having that extra interaction can increase site retention and relevance. The rick-bot acts as the site's assistant which projects Rick's humorous know-it-all attitude many love making dealing with him a much more enjoyable experience. Its main purpose is to further the online experience and make the chore of contacting support an enjoyable task.

No setup on the user's end is necessary, everything is managed server side.
